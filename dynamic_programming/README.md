# Dynamic programming problem

## problem1:
Given an array `A` with length `N`, finding a number of pairs `(i, j)` satisfying the following conditions:

- 0 <= i < j < N
- A[i] > A[j]

## problem2:
Given a maze binary matrix of size 4x4, where 1 means that the path is available and 0 means that the path is unavailable, finding a path from the upper-left element to the lower-right element.
